# OpenSEO on Railway.
#
# Order of business:
#   1. Give the app a private port and keep Railway's injected $PORT for the
#      gate, because the edge healthcheck dials the injected port.
#   2. Default ALLOWED_HOST to the deployment's own public domain. vite preview
#      refuses any Host header that is not in that list, and an empty list
#      means the public URL answers "Blocked request" on every page.
#   3. Refuse to start without a UI password. In local_noauth mode OpenSEO has
#      no login of its own, so an ungated public deploy is an open admin
#      console holding the deployer's DataForSEO credentials.
#   4. Start the app, then hand PID 1 to nginx.
